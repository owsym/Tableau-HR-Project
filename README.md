### As a data analyst, I aim to develop a comprehensive HR dashboard that offers both summarized insights and detailed employee records for effective data analysis.

# Summary View

- The summary view will be structured into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis.

## Overview

- Provide a snapshot of key HR metrics:
- Display total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.
- Visualize trends in hiring and termination over time.
- Break down employees by department and job titles.
- Compare employee distribution between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York as HQ).
- Show geographical distribution of employees by city and state.
  
## Demographics

- Offer insights into workforce composition:
- Present gender distribution across the company.
- Visualize employee distribution by age groups and education levels.
- Display total count of employees within each age group and educational attainment level.
- Analyze correlation between employees' educational backgrounds and performance ratings.
  
## Income Analysis
## Focus on salary-related metrics:
- Compare salaries across different education levels and genders to identify patterns.
- Analyze relationship between age and salary within each department.
  
* Employee Records View

* Provide a comprehensive list of all employees:
- Include necessary details such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.
- Enable flexible filtering based on any available column for detailed data exploration
